          <p>
            ZXY Gallery is proud to announce, *Mei- (1) + *Mei- (2), a group
            exhibition with Liz Ainslie, Andrew Zarou, Chiara, and Nazlie Efe.
            The show is an exploration of these two Proto-Indo-European roots
            that have evidence of their existence in Sanskirt, Latin, Greek, and
            old English. *mei- (1) is the Proto-Indo-European root meaning "to
            change, go, move," *mei- (2) is Proto-Indo-European root meaning
            "small."
          </p>
          <p>
            These divergent meanings allow for a multitude of analogies with the
            artists shown in this exhibition. On focus is a beauty created
            through the softness of material and color. Expressed as painting
            and sculpture, the works explore an aesthetic that carries a sense
            of humility in color via a multitude of themes behind the individual
            works.
