          <p>
            To build upon the shaky foundations of the current epoch, we must be
            hybrids. Survival depends on both physical and mental security,
            which can be at risk at any time. Amphibians provide a model of
            adaptability. Invoking the amphibian seems like a safe bet for
            survival. We must both adapt to the present conditions given to us
            and also evolve for a future uniquely to provide ourselves the
            skills to allow us to flourish in a new paradigm. Flash floods
            ravage NYC and forest fires burn through Turkey. The air may not be
            safe one day and water the next. Amphibious life could become the
            norm. While lessons on survival can be learned from amphibians,
            French sociologist and anthropologist Bruno Latour provides the
            concept of hybrids that focuses on entities existing both in a
            natural and social realm. Attempts to divorce one from the other,
            paradoxically just reinforces their connection. In this sense, to
            survive, we all must be like frogs.
